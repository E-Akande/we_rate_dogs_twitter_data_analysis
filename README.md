# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Analysis
Many would argue, a dog is a man's most loyal companion. Little wonder, dog lovers around the globe have learnt to care for their pets and pay them such attention, most have even become functional parts of many families. It is no surprise then that, a dog owner gets so curious, s/he wants to know how his/her dog compares against others of same/different breeds.

Enter WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Why This Project?

The sole purpose of this project was to gather, explore, analyze and clean data from a real world scenario - in this case, WeRateDogs Twitter Archive. Afterwards, I stored, then drew insights plus visualizations from it all. The WeRateDogs Twitter Archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1st, 2017.

Also, 3 sets of data were needed for this project: 
>
> twitter-archive-enhanced.csv 
> 
> image_predictions.tsv 
> 
> tweet_json.txt.
